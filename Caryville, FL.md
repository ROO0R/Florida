**Brief History** - Caryville's story is deeply intertwined with the Choctawhatchee River, evolving from a critical sawmill town with roots in the late 1800s to a community resilient against nature's challenges. Known for massive timber operations and being the first in Washington County to embrace electric lights, Caryville is a testament to adaptation and community spirit, especially evident through its survival of significant fires and floods. Once bustling with industry and later revitalized through community strength, Caryville now offers a peaceful retreat into Florida's untouched natural beauty.
