**Brief History** - Brooksville, named after a congressman with a controversial past, was established in 1856 from the merger of the towns of Melendez and Pierceville. This charming city, with its roots in the mid-19th century, has a complex history that includes the difficult times of segregation and the Ku Klux Klan's activities. However, today's Brooksville is a welcoming community that celebrates its rich history, including its role as a major citrus production area known as the "Home of the Tangerine"【6†source】.
