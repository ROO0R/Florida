**Brief History** - Reddick, FL, founded in 1882, emerged from the dreams and toils of the Reddick family, who settled in the area sometime between 1850 and 1860. Their contributions, from Samuel's river navigation to John's vital land for railway development, helped shape the town's future. The establishment of the railway in the early 1880s marked Reddick as a pivotal location for the citrus industry until a severe freeze in 1894/95 shifted the community's focus. Today, Reddick stands as a testament to resilience, community spirit, and the timeless charm of small-town America【7】.
