**Where is it?** - Key Biscayne is an island village in Miami-Dade County, Florida, part of the Miami metropolitan area. It's located south of Miami Beach and east of Miami, connected by the Rickenbacker Causeway. This slice of paradise sits in the southeastern part of the state, easily accessible and marked by its lush landscape and stunning Atlantic Ocean views.

**Brief History** - Once the largest coconut plantation in the continental United States, Key Biscayne's development into a residential haven began in the mid-20th century, thanks to the opening of the Rickenbacker Causeway in 1947. This transformation welcomed new homes, a community church, and Key Biscayne Elementary School in the early '50s. Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park's creation followed, preserving the island's southern beauty.
