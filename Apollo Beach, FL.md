**Brief History** - Apollo Beach's journey from mangrove terrain to a scenic waterfront community is nothing short of spectacular. Beginning in 1923 on land owned by the Dickman family, the area transformed from a mere concept by Paul Dickman into a vibrant community. Initially named "Tampa Beach," the project was taken over by Francis Corr, who rebranded it to "Apollo Beach" to highlight its sunny disposition. Today, it's a thriving locale with 55 miles of canals leading to Tampa Bay, embodying a legacy of family, innovation, and sunlit dreams【6†source】.
