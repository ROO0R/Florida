**Brief History** - Nestled in Pasco County, Florida, Elfers is a charming census-designated place with a history deeply rooted in citrus farming. Once known for its sprawling orange groves, the area came into prominence with the establishment of the Elfers post office in 1909, named to honor a beloved uncle of the postmaster's wife. By the 1920s, Elfers was a burgeoning citrus city, with its economy revolving around the cultivation and shipping of citrus fruits. This small town was once so thriving that it became incorporated as a city, complete with its own mayor and city council, although this was later dissolved during the Depression era.
