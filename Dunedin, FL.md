**Brief History** - Dunedin, a city with roots reaching back to the Scottish Highlands, emerged from an eclectic history of pig bans and amphibious innovations. Once a humble settlement with livestock roaming free, it evolved into a WWII manufacturing hub, birthing the ingenious amphibious vehicle known as the Roebling Alligator. Now, it stands as a testament to ingenuity and cultural fusion, nestled on the Gulf Coast, embodying the essence of old Florida with a Scottish twist.
