**Brief History** - Trenton, originally known as Joppa, transformed into its current identity thanks to 18-year-old Ben Boyd, who, after a racetrack brawl, moved from Trenton, Tennessee, and decided on a name change. Officially named in 1883, it grew from fertile soil and agriculture to a bustling small town by 1925, offering everything from toothpicks to coffins. Now, it's a testament to the resilient spirit of its founders and the bountiful beauty of Gilchrist County【10】.
