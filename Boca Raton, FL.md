**Brief History** - Boca Raton, a city where elegance and natural beauty blend seamlessly, has a rich history that traces back to the early 1900s. First incorporated in 1925, it was shaped significantly by architect Addison Mizner in the 1920s. His influence introduced the Mediterranean Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival architectural styles that define the city's distinctive elegance. From its humble beginnings as an agricultural community, Boca Raton transformed into a luxurious resort destination and a key player in the early computer industry with the birth of IBM's first personal computer【6†source】.
