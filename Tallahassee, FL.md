**Brief History** - A place of deep roots and rich history, Tallahassee was chosen as Florida's capital in 1824, thanks to its central location between the then competing cities of St. Augustine and Pensacola. Its name, believed to mean "old fields" or "old town" in the Muskogean language, hints at its long history of inhabitation, first by indigenous peoples and later as the site of the Spanish mission San Luis de Apalachee【6】【6】.
