**Brief History** - Chokoloskee, nestled within Florida's Ten Thousand Islands on the edge of the Everglades, is a historic gem that has witnessed the ebb and flow of time like few other places. Once isolated, this community of around 350 souls is connected to the world yet retains an air of timeless tranquility. It's a land shaped by Native American shell mounds, pioneer spirits, and the tales of "Bloody" Watson, making it a fascinating portal to the past.
