**Brief History** - Fernandina Beach's tapestry is rich with the threads of Timucuan Native Americans, European settlers, and American adventurers. Known as the "Isle of 8 Flags," it's the only location in the U.S. to have had eight different national flags flown over it. The city itself, named after King Ferdinand VII of Spain, holds the distinction of being the last Spanish city platted in the Western Hemisphere, making its story one of intrigue and continual reinvention.
