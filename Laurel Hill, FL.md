**Brief History** - The story of Laurel Hill is a narrative of transformation and resilience. It began in the early 19th century as one of Florida's first English-speaking settlements post-American annexation, originally known as Almirante. With the arrival of the Yellow River Railroad in the 1890s, it blossomed into a booming lumber hub, eventually adopting the name Laurel Hill inspired by a prominent laurel tree at its heart. Despite economic fluctuations over the years, this community has retained its spirit, celebrating its heritage annually with the Laurel Hill Hobo Festival since 1992.
