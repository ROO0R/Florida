**Brief History** - Center Hill carries the whispers of old Florida and the echoes of the Seminole Wars. Once called "Abraham's Old Town", it was a hub for Seminole resistance in the 1830s. By the 1840s, it became a home for settlers like the Mobley and Beville families. This small town, once a string bean capital, has seen its fair share of Florida's agricultural peaks and troughs, adapting and thriving through centuries.
