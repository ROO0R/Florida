**Brief History** - Fort Myers Beach has a rich tapestry of history dating back to American settlements initiated by the Homestead Act of 1862. It evolved from a modest homestead and fishing village into a vibrant vacation destination. The 1920s brought significant development with casinos, hotels, and the first canal, marking the island's transformation into a beach paradise. Despite the setbacks of hurricanes and economic depressions, the community thrived, eventually incorporating in 1995. The town's spirit was tested but unbroken by Hurricane Ian in 2022, showing resilience and a commitment to rebuild better than ever.
