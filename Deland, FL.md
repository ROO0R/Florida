**Brief History** - From its beginnings as Persimmon Hollow, named for the wild persimmon trees around its natural springs, Deland was envisioned by its founder, Henry A.

Today, Deland is known for its historic sites, including Stetson University, Florida's first private college, and for hosting the DeLand Fall Festival of the Arts, drawing over 50,000 visitors annually【6†source】.
