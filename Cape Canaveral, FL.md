**Brief History** - For over 12,000 years, Cape Canaveral has been a land of historical significance, from the earliest native inhabitants through Spanish explorations and the epoch of space exploration. Initially noted on maps in the early 16th century and named by Spanish explorers, its name, meaning "place of canes, or reeds," is one of the oldest surviving European place names in the U.S. This strip of Florida's Atlantic coast has witnessed shipwrecks, Spanish missions, and the rise of America's space program, encapsulating a rich tapestry of human endeavor against the backdrop of its natural beauty.
