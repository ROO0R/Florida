**Where is it?** - Looking for a slice of paradise? Direct your eyes to Florida's panhandle, right on the Gulf of Mexico. That’s where you’ll find Panama City Beach (PCB), a gem with 27 miles of stunning beaches waiting for you.

**Brief History** - PCB wasn’t always the bustling beach resort town it is today. A construction boom in the early 2000s reshaped its landscape, transitioning from older homes and motels to luxurious condos and expansive homes. This evolution was sparked by a real estate boom that placed PCB on the map as a prime vacation spot, especially noted for its incredible spring break vibe.
