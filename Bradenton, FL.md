**Brief History** - Bradenton's story is woven from the threads of adventure, perseverance, and cultural fusion. Originally home to a maroon settlement named Angola, Bradenton has transformed from a frontier outpost to a vibrant city by the Manatee River. Named after Dr. Joseph Braden, whose sugar plantation and refuge fort-like house marked early settler resilience, this city has evolved into a hub of history, nature, and art, embracing its rich past and bright future.
